Download the two script files (these will take care of setting up the repos and cloning from github)


# Run the Script File 1 script1.sh:
# this will clone the repository from github and setup the dataset folders


# Run Script file 2 (script2.sh --- place it inside path algoProject/cliques/sjain12-cliquecounting-1e8e64987b2e/graphs
execute this script from inside algoProject/cliques/sjain12-cliquecounting-1e8e64987b2e/graphs folder.

this will transform the datasets in to .edges format and instantiate all the tests, varying parameters, and using differnt clique counting algorithm, including the naive bruteforce one.

# Results can be found in the results directory.
